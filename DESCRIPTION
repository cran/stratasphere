Description: For data where the observations occur or are collected in
        a stratified fashion, the strata level effect is sometimes not
        of interest or is simply impossible to estimate. Conditioning
        on the strata eliminates these difficulties, but leads to a
        combinatorially complex calculation. The spherical approximate
        method replaces this complex calculation with a closed form
        solution, leading to a simple fixed point iteration method for
        fitting the linear model.  This package implements linear model
        fitting via Stratasphere(), and stepwise regression and
        boosting extensions via StratasphereStep() and
        StratasphereBoost(), respectively. Note that this package is
        distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.
